Task 02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this task:we explored a dataset with details like age, gender, income, profession, platform usage, and more. The goal was to understand the data better using statistics and visual charts.
Visual Discovery:
1. Histogram
A histogram shows how often each value or range of values appears in a column.
 for example, are most users young or old? Are incomes low, medium, or high?
2. Boxplot
A boxplot displays the minimum, maximum, average, and outliers in the data.
It helps you find outliers (values that are very high or low) and shows if the data is balanced or skewed.
3. Countplot
A countplot shows how many times each category appears, like how many users are male or female, or which platform is most used.
It helps understand which category is the most or least common.
4. Correlation Heatmap
A heatmap shows how strongly two numeric features are related to each other (like age and income).
It helps to check if one feature affects another, which is important for building models.
5. Pairplot
A pairplot shows scatter plots between pairs of numeric features all in one big grid.
It helps you spot relationships or patterns between features like income and time spent.
6. Barplot (Grouped)
A barplot compares the average of a numeric value (like income) across categories (like profession or gender).
Doing EDA helps us understand the data better before we build any machine learning models. We can find mistakes, missing values, and get useful insights just by looking at charts and numbers.
